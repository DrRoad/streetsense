# New MTurk Survey Notes
The aim of the new MTurk results was to see the size of potholes and cracks, as well as provide increased accuracy in conjunction with the previous MTurk data. The new survey was designed for two HITs per photo.
### Lagos Survey
The Lagos data had a few difficulties. The survey expired with three HITs left. It was discovered that two of the HITs came from a photo that did not exist, photo 0067. The third HIT that was not completed was photo 0959. The missing responses for photo 0959 was manually entered into the data.
