#Investigating Accuracy MTurk Data To understand the quality of the MTurk data, we have coded 100 photos from each city to compare with the MTurk data. The photos that were coded were randomized. While going through the photos, several things came up that are worth clarifying. *Several columns were added when we went through the data, such as “side of the road markings”, “glitches”, and “sidewalk crack”. These columns were added to help us understand why there are certain disparities between the MTurk data and the data we collected. “side of the road markings” include markings on the sidewalk, which we would not consider “road markings”. “glitches” include irregularities in the photo that might be mistaken for a crack or pothole. We included “sidewalk crack” because we would not want MTurkers to code “rode crack” based on a sidewalk crack. *Several photos in the database are not photos of roads. Some of the photos are photos of walls, for example. These photos might skew our data because people will not see any cracks, potholes, or road markings because there is no road. *Additionally, part of the coding is inherently subjective. It can be difficult to discern cracks or potholes from the photos, and someone might see a pothole where another would not. This issue is compounded by issues with glitches, which can make it appear like there is a shadow from a pothole in the road. Cracks represent another issue with interpretation. Some roads are built such a way that the road is built in segments, and the space between segments are cracks. We decided that this will not be considered cracks for our purposes, as we wish to examine the quality of roads. Our goal is to code for cracks that represent wear and tear on a road, rather than the way that the road was built.
